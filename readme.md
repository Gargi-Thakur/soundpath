# SoundPath 

SoundPath is a Progressive Web App (PWA) created by a team of 4 developers using Spotify Web API with Implicit Grant Flow authorization, which helps users to build a customizable playlist

Please note that the app is a frontend project that only works with the session token generated using Postman and expires after a few hours.
