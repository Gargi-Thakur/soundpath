# Boilerplate with descriptions about PWA 



### Based on PWA video series from 'The Net Ninja'  YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XT23X0Fjfk

I've left the images/pages/folders from the tutorial in the hope of speeding up our app's implementation. 

## The files that I recommend to have a look at are:

- /sw.js (the Service Worker file)
- /js/app.js  (the file that will register the Service Worker)
- /manifest.json (the manifest file)
- /index.html (on the <head> area)

- What I **DID NOT** make use from the video series and that will not be included in the Boilerplat:

  - Limiting the Cache Size.

  - 'Firestore' Database like adding/deleting/hooking to the app because they seemed to be much more related to the tutorial's app itself rather than our own general use. Aside of that, I did manage to deploy the app on FIrebase in order to achieve the PWS Optimization criteria of HTTP to HTTPS.
